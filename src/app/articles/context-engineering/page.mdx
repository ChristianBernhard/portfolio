## Context Engineering in 2 Minutes

🎯 Context Engineering in 2 Minutes

LLMs don't just process prompts anymore - Agents handle system instructions, memory, retrieved data, tools, and more. Context Engineering means giving the model only what it really needs. 

Why is that important?
💸 You pay for every token
⚠️ Irrelevant or wrong context = degraded answers (e.g., context poisoning)
🧠 Good context → better output, faster responses, lower cost

Correct context is all you need.
